This was originally created before a convenient shortcut existed for this in finder (command-shift-period).

This is a macOS workflow for toggling hidden files in terminal. You should be able to set a keyboard shortcut to use it easily. Alternately, you can go to Finder -> Services -> Toggle Hidden Files.
